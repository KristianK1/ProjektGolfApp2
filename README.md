# ProjektGolfApp2

This app is an improvment on the app held in the ProjectGolfApp1 repository.

Here I will describe how is it used.

Login screen:
Here every user can login with username and password.

There is a separate register screen (username, password, password again)

Main screen:
Once the user is logged in, by defualt he can't see any cars on map. He has to go to the settings page to setup devices.
If the user has done that he can see the path of a car.

The page is automaticly refreshed every 10 seconds if the button in the middle is green.
Every time that a user interacts with the map by zooming in/out or moving the map the button turns red and auto-refresh stops and is activated again by clicking the middle button.

There are several things that a user can do in the settings screen:
    - logout

Add device screen:

To add a device you need devices credentials.

To obtain the credentials, it is necessary to contact Kristian directly.
The information linked to these credentials includes the location data of Kristian's car as well as the historical records of the car's whereabouts.
If you are considering employing Kristian, you can certainly obtain the credentials by reaching out to him personally.
